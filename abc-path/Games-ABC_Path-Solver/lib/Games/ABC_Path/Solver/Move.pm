=head1 VERSION

Version 0.3.0

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.3.0';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Games::ABC_Path::Solver::Move;

    my $foo = Games::ABC_Path::Solver::Move->new();

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 new

The constructor.

=cut

use base 'Games::ABC_Path::Solver::Base';

=head2 get_text()

A method that retrieves the text of the move.

=cut

sub get_text
{
    my $self = shift;

    my $text = $self->_format;

    $text =~ s/%\((\w+)\)\{(\w+)\}/
        $self->_expand_format($1,$2)
        /ge;

    return $text;
}

sub _depth {
    my $self = shift;

    if (@_) {
        $self->{_depth} = shift;
    }

    return $self->{_depth};
}

=head2 get_depth()

A method that retrieves the solving recursion depth of the move.

=cut

sub get_depth
{
    my ($self) = @_;

    return $self->_depth();
}

sub _init
{
    my ($self, $args) = @_;

    $self->{_text} = $args->{text};
    $self->_depth($args->{depth} || 0);
    $self->{_vars} = ($args->{vars} || {});

    return;
}

=head2 bump

Creates a new identical move with an incremented depth.

=cut

sub bump
{
    my ($self) = @_;

    return ref($self)->new(
        {
            text => $self->get_text(),
            depth => ($self->get_depth+1),
            vars => { %{$self->{_vars}}, },
        }
    );
}

=head2 $self->get_var($name)

This method returns the raw, unformatted value of the move's variable (or its
parameter) called $name. Each move class contains several parameters that can
be accessed programatically.

=cut

sub get_var
{
    my ($self, $name) = @_;

    return $self->{_vars}->{$name};
}

# TODO : duplicate code with ::Board
my @letters = (qw(A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y));

sub _expand_format
{
    my ($self, $name, $type) = @_;

    my $value = $self->get_var($name);

    if ($type eq "letter")
    {
        return $letters[$value];
    }
    elsif ($type eq "coords")
    {
        return sprintf("(%d,%d)", $value->x()+1, $value->y()+1);
    }
    else
    {
        die "Unknown format type '$type'!";
    }
}
