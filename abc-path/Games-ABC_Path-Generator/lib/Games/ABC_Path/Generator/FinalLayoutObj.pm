=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Games::ABC_Path::Generator;

    my $gen = Games::ABC_Path::Generator->new({seed => 1});

    # Returns a Games::ABC_Path::Generator::FinalLayoutObj object.
    my $layout = $gen->calc_final_layout();

    my $A_xy = $layout->get_A_xy();

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 my $layout = Games::ABC_Path::Generator::FinalLayoutObj->new({%args}); 

Initializes a new layout. B<For internal use.>.

sub _s
{
    my $self = shift;

    if (@_)
    {
        $self->{_s} = shift;
    }

    return $self->{_s};
}

sub _init
{
    my $self = shift;
    my $args = shift;

    $self->_s($args->{layout_string});

    return;
}

=head2 $layout->get_A_pos()

Returns the position of the letter 'A'.

=cut

sub get_A_pos
{
    my ($self) = @_;

    return index($self->_s, chr(1));
}

=head2 $layout->get_A_xy()

Returns the (X,Y) coordinates of the letter A as a C<< {x => $x, y => $y} >>
hash reference.

=cut

sub get_A_xy
{
    my ($self) = @_;

    my ($y, $x) = $self->_to_xy($self->get_A_pos());

    return {y => $y, x => $x,};
}

=head2 $layout->get_cell_contents($index)

Returns the cell at index L<$index> (where index is C< $Y*5 + $X>).

=cut

sub get_cell_contents
{
    my ($self, $index) = @_;

    return vec($self->_s, $index, 8) ;
}

=head2 my $letter = $layout->get_letter_at_pos({y => $y, x => $x});

Returns the letter at $y and $x .

=cut

{
    my ($self, $pos) = @_;

    return $letters[
        $self->get_cell_contents(
            $self->_xy_to_int(

            )
        )-1,
    ];
}

=head2 $layout->as_string($args);

Represents the layout as string.
